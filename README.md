# Trees of Somalia
## Background

In 1990 Desmond Mahony, under Oxfam International, published a field guide that compiled critical information on the flora that exists in Somalia. A year later the civil war would break out. It was because of this that the guide, which was created to be a starting point to compile information on the ecological environment of the country, was never truly built upon and also why Somalia lacks a comprehensive guide on the country's ecology. Recently there has been a renewed interest to continue research and exploration in this field. Mr. Mahony’s guide serves as an excellent foundation, but while it would have been considered accessible at the time of its publishing, in this age there are better tools at our disposal to compile this kind of data in ways that can be queried, shared, and further transformed.

## Project Goal

Transform the information from the guide into a relational database that can be easily queried and later built upon with additional ecological data from other sources or as it is discovered.

## Methods

This project will use Python’s Pandas library and Excel to clean and transform the data. The cleaned data frames will then be imported to prepared tables in a MySQL database.
